			<description>A large, distinctive-looking tree with a unique life-cycle, warm, skin-smooth bark and long iridescent leaves. Infused with bioluminescent micro-organisms, anima trees develop a unique form of psychic symbiosis with surrounding lifeforms. Each Ancient Anima tree contains a small non-conscious dryad queen. The queen births creatures called dryads which guard and tend the tree. In exchange, the tree nurtures its protectors by feeding them directly. From the outside, it appears the dryads are created by the tree directly and act as part of it.\n\nIt is possible for a person to form a connection with a tree and partially control the dryads it produces.\n\nSome say Ancient Anima trees are the homes of nature spirits that follow humanity across worlds. Tribal psycasters are also able to draw psyfocus from anima trees while meditating to them.\n\nAnima trees' psychic properties are weakened if artificial structures are placed nearby. They refuse to be caged or studied, and must remain part of nature.</description>
